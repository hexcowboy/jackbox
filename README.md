By default docker containers are ephemeral. If you wish to has persistent storage and save files between sessions, use a docker volume
```bash
# The path on the left of the : is the docker volume name
# The path on the right is the folder on the docker container
docker run -it -v jackbox:/root jackbox
```

volume
```bash
docker volume inspect jackbox

        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,

        "Name": "jackbox",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
