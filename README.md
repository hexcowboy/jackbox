# Saloon

Saloon is a hacking environment that is rapidly available in the Docker cloud. Compared to the estimated 30 minute setup with Kali or Parrot, Saloon takes roughly 5 minutes to install.

## üöÄ Installation

### Requirements

* Windows (with WSL2), macOS, Linux
* Docker
* Python 3

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pipx install saloon
# or
pip3 install saloon
```

## üß® Running Saloon

Once the container image is pulled, you can start running commands
```bash
# Get an interactive shell
saloon

# Run a command and then exit
saloon -- nmap -p80 -sC -sV scanme.nmap.org
```

### Networking

> *Networking is not available\*, but soon you will be able to do things like set up a netcat listener an accept incoming connections or set up a Burp Suite proxy.*

<small>* exception: Linux hosts can interact with saloon from the host interface (127.0.0.1)</small>

### Running GUI applications

The Docker container is compatible with X11. You just need to set your local XServer to listen on 127.0.0.1.

> *‚ö†Ô∏è All of the following setups disable access control on your X Server. Make sure your X Server cannot be accessed by any untrusted networks.*
