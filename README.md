## üß® Running Jackbox

Once the container image is built, you can attach to jackbox with Docker
```bash
# The -it flag is required to have an interactive TTY
docker run -it jackbox
```

By default docker containers are ephemeral. If you wish to has persistent storage and save files between sessions, use a docker volume
```bash
# The path on the left of the : is the docker volume name
# The path on the right is the folder on the docker container
docker run -it -v jackbox-root:/root jackbox

# Mount multiple directories with
docker run -it \
  -v jackbox-root:/root \
  -v jackbox-opt:/opt \
  -v jackbox-etc:/etc \
  -v jackbox-var:/var \
  -v jackbox-usr:/usr \
  -v jackbox-bin:/bin \
  jackbox
```

You can see where docker has put this mount by inspecting the
volume
```bash
docker volume inspect jackbox
